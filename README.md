**Motivation**

We are students from nus SoC and FoS.

In every semester, students in NUS take numerous modules with project requirements which require finding a telegram group chat and locating groupmates and study buddies. This task gets tedious when you are introverted or taking a module alone. 

Currently many choose to post in the reddit forum r/NUS to look for module chats, groupmates or study buddies. Yet as too many similar posts clout the forum, it becomes troublesome for students to find the exact match of their need for their respective modules, having to scroll through pages of posts and direct messaging many users.

Locating fellow students in the same module and finding project group mates or study buddies will always be a need for NUS students due to the nature of our courses. So why isn’t there an autobot to help students with this task so we don’t have to waste time roaming through Reddit?  

**User Stories**

- As a student who wants to find classmates of a module, I want to be able to get a telegram group link of the respective module.
- As a student who wants to find groupmates of a module, I want to be able to match with others with the same need without having to manually search by myself.
- As a student who wants to find a study buddy, I want to be able to match with others based on faculty.

**Features -- A Reddit Bot and a Telegram Bot**

- Reddit bot - automated replies to posts looking for modules' telegroup links on r/NUS.
- Telegram bot - random matching for students based on requirements for project mates (based on module) and study buddies (based on faculty).
